## Supertask is a NodeJS task queue designed for parallel and cluster execution with optimizations.

**Supertask** was designed to run tasks in parallel and enable for a connected interface to distribute tasks across a network or cluster. A task can either be a local JavaScript function or in form of source which is then compiled and sandboxed through the VM. To get a clear idea of the intended use, check out [Supertask-cluster](https://github.com/schahriar/supertask-cluster) a superset of this module still in development that automatically runs and handles tasks on a NodeJS cluster of Workers. (one per CPU core)

# Installation
Note that Supertask requires *ES6* and is designed to run on NodeJS 4.x and above.
```javascript
npm install supertask
```

# Usage
Create a new local task with a unique name. Note that a unique name is required for every task.
```javascript
var Supertask = require('supertask');
var TaskManager = new Supertask();

TaskManager.addLocal('taskname', function power(n, x, callback) {
    // n^x function
    callback(null, Math.pow(n,x));
}, function callback(error, task) {
    console.log("Task was created", task);
});
```

Run task. You can pass arguments after name and before callback.

```javascript
TaskManager.do('taskname', 2, 4, function callback(error, result) {
    console.log("2^4 is equal to", result);
});
```

Add a foreign task
```javascript
// Source from network I/O etc.
var source = "module.exports = function power(n, x, callback) { callback(null, Math.pow(n,x)); }"
TaskManager.addForeign('foreignPow', source, function callback(error, task) {
    console.log("Task was created", task);
});
```

Add a remote task
```javascript
// Launch task on cluster, etc.
var handler = function(arg1, arg2, ..., callback) {
    // launch on cluster
    callback(error, result1, result2);
};
TaskManager.addRemote('foreignPow', handler, function callback(error, task) {
    console.log("Task was created", task);
});
```

More documentation and methods coming soon. Check out the test functions for more information in the mean time.

## Disclaimer
This module is not *yet* ready to be used in a production environment. While Supertask has reasonably good stability with over 40 tests it does not fully expose all methods and capabilities and may not function as intended. Supertask-cluster is equally missing some important cluster monitoring methods to keep the cluster alive and well in a production environment. Use it at your own risk.
